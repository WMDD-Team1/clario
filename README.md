# 🚀 Clario — AI-Driven Contract & Finance Management Platform

**Clario** is a full-stack SaaS platform designed to help freelancers and independent professionals manage contracts, finances, and critical business documents in one secure workspace.  
Built as a collaborative academic team project, the platform leverages AI-assisted analysis to extract key insights from legal documents, reducing manual review time and improving financial visibility for non-technical users.

## ❎ Problem

Freelancers often struggle with:

- Scattered contracts and financial records across multiple tools  
- Time-consuming manual review of legal documents  
- Limited visibility into income, obligations, and financial risk  

Most existing tools focus on **storage**, not **understanding**.

**Clario was created to transform documents into actionable insights.**
